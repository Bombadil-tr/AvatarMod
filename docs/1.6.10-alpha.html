We've skipped a lot of versions, but just look at them on curseforge :)

--Rendering--
-Support for CCL (Code Chicken Lib!) Spheres, cones, and cylinders!
    *Use the config to choose which abilities you want to look super-awesome and realistic :)
-New cube and prism rendering!
    *Water cannon and other abilities have been updated, they're now way cooler! And less glitchy.
-Albedo support! A lot of moves now create light sources, making the mod feel more alive!
    *Literally all fire abilities, and lightning abilities.
    *Also improves buff abilities :)
