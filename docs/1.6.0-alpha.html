We've skipped a lot of versions, but just look at them on curseforge :)

--Rendering--
    -Support for CCL (Code Chicken Lib!) Spheres, cones, and cylinders!
        *Use the config to choose which abilities you want to look super-awesome and realistic :)
    -New cube and prism rendering!
        *Water cannon and other abilities have been updated, they're now way cooler! And less glitchy.
    -Albedo support! A lot of moves now create light sources, making the mod feel more alive!
        *Literally all fire and lightning abilities.
        *Also improves buff abilities :)

--GUI + HUD--
-We've improved the GUI and HUD! More config options and better modpack compatibility :)

    *New textures for Light Fire (Now Fire Shot) and Fire Arc (now Fire Blast).

--Items--
-Gliders!!!! FINALLY! With wind and everything :)
-Tiered Scrolls!
    *Explained below in gameplay, but all scrolls now recipes, including all tiers!


--Gameplay--
    -New Scroll System!
        --Tiers--
            *All scrolls now have tiers from 1 to 7 (I to VII).
            *Abilities now require a minimum tier to unlock/level up.
            *Abilities are organised by tier.
        --Better Loot--
            *Loot has been re-organised (code-wise as well :D)! Everything should now make more sense xD
            *Tiered scrolls are implemented in the loot system, so everything's more balanced!
    -Fixed collision stuff with the ender dragon! Abilities no longer push it weirdly into outer space, and they all properly damage it! Pretty sweet, right?
    -All abilities now have proper xp implementation when calculating effects!
    -Revamped abilities! Yay!!! Doesn't include rendering changes, only functional changes.
        --Fire--
            *Light Fire> Fire Shot. You now shoot a small fireball to where you're looking.
            *Fire Arc> Fire Blast. Instantaneous cloud of flame, like in the show.
            *Flamethrower. It actually functions like a flamethrower now :)
    -There's now a config option for spawning with a random element! It's enabled by default.

--Other Aesthetics--
    -Brand new particles!
        *A brand new particle system!
        *Brand new effects for air and fire! Everything looks dynamic and fluid!

        *Also works with the new scroll system
    -Got rid of some unused textures (smaller file size!)
    -Better Quests support!
        *Create your own custom quests with better quests and this mod for awesome modpacks and servers!
